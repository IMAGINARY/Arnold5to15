\begin{abstract}
This brochure consists of 77 problems for development of thinking culture, either selected or composed by the author.
Most of them do not require any special knowledge beyond the general education. However, solving some of them may
turn out challenging even for professors.

The book is addressed to school and university students, teachers, parents -- to everybody who considers the thinking culture 
an essential part of the personality development.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Preface}
I put these problems onto paper in Paris in spring 2004 when Russian Parisians asked me to help
their young children gain the thinking culture traditional for Russia.

I am deeply convinced that this culture is most of all cultivated by early independent reflection
on simple, but not easy questions similar to those below (problems 1, 3, 13 are the most recommended).

My long experience has shown that, very frequently, dimwits falling at school behind solve them better
than A-grade pupils, since -- for their survival at the back of the classroom -- they must permanently
think more than required ``for governing the whole Seville and Granada", as Figaro used to say about
himself, while A-graders cannot catch ``what should be multiplied by what" in these problems.
I have also noticed that five year old kids solve similar problems better than pupils spoiled
by coaching, which in their turn cope with the questions better than university students used
to swotting who anyway beat their professors (the worst in solving these simple problems are
Nobel and Fields prize winners).

\section*{The problems}
\begin{problem}{1.}
	Masha was seven kopecks short to buy a first reading book, and Misha lacked one kopeck.
	They combined their money to buy one book to share, but even then they did not have enough.
	How much did the book cost?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{2.}
	A bottle with a cork costs 10 kopecks, while the bottle itself is 9 kopecks more expensive
	than the cork. How much does the bottle without the cork cost?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{3.}
	A brick weighs one pound and half the brick. How many pounds does the brick weigh?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{4.}
	A spoon of wine is poured from a barrel of wine into a (not full) glass of tea.
	After that, the same spoon of the (inhomogeneous) mixture from the glass is taken back into the barrel.
	Now both in the barrel and in the glass there is a certain volume of the foreign liquid (wine in the glass and
	tea in the barrel). In which is the volume of the foreign liquid greater: in the glass or in the barrel?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{5.}
	Two old ladies left from $A$ to $B$ and from $B$ to $A$ at dawn
	heading towards one another (along the same road). They met at noon,
	but did not stop, and each of them carried on walking with the same speed.
	The first lady came (to $B$) at 4pm, and the second (to $A$) at 9pm. What time was the dawn that day? 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{6.}
	The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle (in a standard American examination) is 10 inches,
	the altitude dropped onto it is 6 inches. Find the area of the triangle.

	American school students had been coping successfully with this problem over a decade.
	But then Russian school students arrived from Moscow, and none of them was able to solve it as had their American peers
	(giving 30 square inches as the answer). Why? 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{7.}
	Vasya has 2 sisters more than he has brothers. How many daughters more than sons do Vasya's parents have?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{8.}
	There is a round lake in South America. Every year, on June 1, a Victoria Regia flower appears at its
	centre (its stem rises from the bottom, and its petals lie on the water like those of a water lily). Every day
	the area of the flower doubles, and on July 1, it finally covers the entire lake, drops its petals, and its seeds
	sink to the bottom. On which date is the flower's area half the area of the lake?    
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{9.}
	A peasant must take a wolf, a goat and a cabbage across a river in a boat. However the boat is so small that
	he is able to take only one of the three on board with him. How should he transport all three across
	the river? (The wolf cannot be left alone with the goat, and the goat cannot be left alone with the cabbage.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{10.}
	During the daytime a snail climbs 3 cm up a post, and during the night, falling asleep, accidentally
	goes down by 2 cm. The post is 10 m high, and a delicious (for the snail) sweet is on its top.
	In how many days will the snail get the sweet?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{11.}
	A ranger walked from his tent 10 km southwards, turned east, walked straight eastwards 10 km more,
	met his bear friend, turned north and after another 10 km found himself by his tent. What colour was the bear
	and where did all this happen?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{12.}
	A tide was in today at 12 noon. What time will it be in (at the same place) tomorrow?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{13.}
	Two volumes of Pushkin, the first and the second, are side-by-side on a bookshelf. The pages of each
	volume are 2 cm thick, and the cover -- front and back each -- is 2 mm. A bookworm has gnawed through
	(perpendicular to the pages) from the first page of volume 1 to the last page of volume 2.

	How long is the bookworm's track?

	[This topological problem with an incredible answer -- 4 mm -- is absolutely impossible for academicians,
	but some preschoolers handle it with ease.]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{14.}
	Find a body with views from the top and from the front as depicted (polytopes).
	Depict its side view (showing invisible edges of the polytope dashed).

\begin{problem}{15.}
	How many ways are there to break up the number 64 into 10 natural summands (integers $\ge 1$),
	whose maximum is 12?

	[Ways that differ only by the order of their summands do not count as different.]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{16.}
	By putting a few similar bars one onto another (for example, domino pieces),
	one can make a length $x$ overhang. What is the maximal attainable value of the overhang length $x$?

\begin{problem}{17.}
	The distance between cities $A$ and $B$ is 40 km. Two cyclists leave respectively from $A$ and $B$ simultaneously
	towards one another, one with speed 10 km/h and the other with speed 15 km/h. A fly flies out with the first
	cyclist from $A$ with the speed of 100km/h, reaches the second, touches his forehead and flies back to the first,
	touches his forehead, returnes to the second, and so on until the cyclists' foreheads collide and squash
	the fly.
	How many kilometers altogether has the fly flown?

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{18.}
	One domino piece covers two squares of a chessboard. 
	Cover all the squares
	except for two opposite ones (on the same diagonal) with 31 pieces. [A chessboard consists of $8 \times 8 = 64$ squares.]

\begin{problem}{21.}
	There are five heads and fourteen legs in a family. How many people and how many dogs are in the family?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{22.}
	Equilateral triangles are constructed externally on sides $AB$, $BC$ and $CA$ of a triangle $ABC$.
	Prove that their centres ($*$) form an equilateral triangle.

\begin{problem}{23.}

\begin{problem}{24.}
	Draw a straight line through the centre of a cube so that the sum of squares of the distances to it
	from the eight vertices of the cube would be
	a) maximal,
	b) minimal (comparing with other such lines).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{25.}
	A right circular cone is cut by a plane along a closed curve. Two balls insribed into the cone
	are tangent to the plane, one at point $A$ and the other at point $B$. Find a point $C$ on the cut line so
	that the sum of the distances $CA + CB$ would be a) maximal, b) minimal.

\begin{problem}{26.}
	The Earth's surface is projected onto the cyliner formed by the lines tangent to the meridians
	at their equatorial points along the rays parallel to the equator and passing through the Earth's pole axis.
	Will the area of the projection of France be greater or smaller than the area of France itself?

\begin{problem}{27.}
	Prove that the remainder of division of the number $2^{p-1}$ by an odd prime $p$ is 1
	(examples: $2^2 = 3a +1,$ $2^4 = 5b+1,$ $2^6 = 7c+1,$ 
	$2^{10} - 1 = 1023 = 11\cdot 93$).  
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{28.}
	A needle 10 cm long is thrown randomly onto lined paper with the distance between neighbouring
	lines also 10 cm. This is repeated
	$N$ (a million) times. 
	How many times (approximately, up to a few per
	cent error) will the fallen needle intersect a line on the paper?
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\footnotesize
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{taskbook-12}
	\end{figure}

	One can perform (as I did at the age of 10) this experiment with $N=100$ instead of a million throws.
	[The answer to this problem is suprising: $\frac2{\pi}N$. Moreover even for a bent needle of length $a \cdot 10$
	cm the number of intersections observed over $N$ throws will be approximately $\frac{2a}{\pi}N$. 
	The number $\pi \approx  \frac{355}{113} \approx \frac{22}7.$]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{29.}
	Polyhedra with triangular faces are, for example, Platonic solids: tetrahedron (4 faces),
	octahedron (8 of them), icosahedron (20 -- and all the faces are the same; it is interesting to draw it,
	it has 12 vertices and 30 edges).

\begin{problem}{30.}
	A dodecahedron is a convex polyhedron with twelve (regular) pentagonal
	faces, twenty vertices
	and thirty edges (its vertices are the centres of the faces of an icosahedron).

	Inscribe into a dodecahedron five cubes (the vertices of each cube are vertices of the dodecahedron)
	whose edges are diagonals of faces of the dodecahedron (a cube has 12 edges, one per face).
	[This was invented by Kepler for the sake of planets.]

\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{33.}

\begin{problem}{39.}
	If two polygons have equal areas, then they may be cut into a finite number of polygonal parts which may then be rearranged to obtain both the first and second polygons. Prove this!. [For spatial solids this is not the case: the cube and tetrahedron of equal volumes cannot be cut this way!]

	A cup tournament has $n$ participating teams, each losing team leaves, and the overall winner is decided after $n-1$ games.
	The tournament schedule may be written symbolically as, for instance,  $((a,(b,c)),d)$ meaning $b$ plays $c$, the winner meets $a$, and the winner of those meets $d$].

	Consider the sequence of powers of two: $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $16$, $32$, $64$,
	$128$, $256$, $512$, $1024$, $2048, \dots$ . Among the first twelve numbers, four have their decimal expression

	Find an exact formula for $p_1, \dots, p_9$.

	%\noindent
	\medskip
	\begin{note}{Hint:}
		The first digit of a number $x$ is determined by the fractional part
		of the number $\log_{10} x$, therefore one has to consider the sequence of the fractional parts of
		the numbers $m \alpha$, where $\alpha=\log_{10} 2$.
	\end{note}

	%\noindent 
	Prove that these fractional parts are distributed over the interval from 0 to~1
	uniformly: out of the $n$ fractional parts of the numbers $m \alpha$, $0 \leqslant m<n$,
	a subinterval $A$ will contain the quantity~$k_n (A)$ such that, for $n \to \infty$,

	$g^{T (x)} x=x$ for certain integer $T>0$).

\begin{problem}{76.}
	In the notation of problem 74 prove that, for almost all points $x$ of the torus,
	the sequence of points $\{g^T (x)\}$, $T=1, 2, \dots$, is everywhere dense in the torus
	(points $x$ without this property constitute a set of measure zero).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{77.}
	In problems 74 and 76 prove that the sequence $\{g^T (x)\}$, $T=1, 2, \dots$, is distributed
	over the torus uniformly: if a domian $A$ contains $k_n(A)$ points out of the $n$ with $T=1, 2, \dots,n$, then
	$$
	\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{k_n(A)}{n}=\frac{\operatorname{mes} A}{\operatorname{mes} M}
	$$

\begin{note}{Note to problem 13.}
	I tried to illustrate with this problem the difference in approaches to tasks by mathematicians and physicists, in my invited paper in the journal ``Physics -- Uspekhi" for the 2000 Christmas jubilee. My success surpassed by far what I intended: the editors, unlike preschoolers, on whom I had been basing my experience, failed to solve the problem, and therefore altered it to match my 4mm answer as follows: instead of ``from the first page of volume 1 to the last page of volume 2"  they typeset  ``from the {\em last\/} page of volume 1 to the {\em first\/} page of volume 2".

	This true story is so implausible that I am including it here: the proof is the editors' version published by the journal.
